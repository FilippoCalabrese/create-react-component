# create-react-component

Add new command in the command line to create a react component

## Setup

To setup crete-react-component, you need to run
`npm install -g create-react-component-cli`.

This command will install the CLI globally, so that you can use it in any react project.

## Usage

To create a new react component, you just need to run `create-react-component ComponentName`.
This will create a new component in src/components (the filesystem structure follows the [redux ducks proposal](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux)).

If you don't want to use the default folder, you can pass a custom path as a parameter (`create-react-component ComponentName --path=my/dir`) and it will create the element in your custom directory.

To have a look at all the functionalities of the the CLI, you can run `create-react-component --help`.
